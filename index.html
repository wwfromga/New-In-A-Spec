<h1>What's New in A Spec</h1>

<p>We list the new stuff that comes with more recent specifications, relative to
the previous version (whatever "version" means nowadays).</p>

<p>I will happily receive any request for changes if something is not up-to-date,
or a misunderstanding on my part.  Please raise an issue.  Ideally, I'd love you
to give me proof of what you say is true.</p>
